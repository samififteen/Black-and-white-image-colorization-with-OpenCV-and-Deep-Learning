# Black-and-white-image-colorization-with-OpenCV-and-Deep-Learning
Black and white image colorization uses OpenCV and Deep Learning to restore natural colors to grayscale images. By leveraging pre-trained neural networks, the model learns color distributions from large datasets, enabling realistic color predictions. This approach enhances old photographs, historical archives.
