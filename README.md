# Black-and-white-image-colorization-with-OpenCV-and-Deep-Learning
Black and white image colorization uses OpenCV and Deep Learning to restore natural colors to grayscale images. By leveraging pre-trained neural networks, the model learns color distributions from large datasets, enabling realistic color predictions. This approach enhances old photographs, historical archives.

## Features
- **AI-powered colorization** for grayscale images
- **Pre-trained neural networks** for realistic color application
- **Image processing enhancements** using OpenCV
- **Ideal for restoring old photographs** and artistic transformations
- **Creative AI-driven results** with deep learning techniques

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (Image processing)
- **NumPy** (Data handling)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have:
- Python 3.x installed
- Download the pre-trained models mentioned in `requirements.txt` and place them in 'model' folder

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samififteen/Black-and-white-image-colorization-with-OpenCV-and-Deep-Learning.git
   cd Black-and-white-image-colorization-with-OpenCV-and-Deep-Learning

2. Run the application:
python app.py

## Usage
